                    <p>I graduated Syracuse University in 1992 :) then moved on to my masters degree at the Wilmington University. Athletics and sports have been a part of my life starting at a very young age. I was a varsity softball athlete throughout high school, I moved to Colorado to pursue skiing, hiking and mountain biking then grew into the sport of running and biking. I participate in many local races and have taken part in 4 sprint triathlons. I’ve always been know to follow my heart and search out new challenges physically and mentally.</p>
                    <p>In 2007 my heart found CrossFit. I have been in love ever since. I am the owner of CrossFit Rivefront and it has grown to be my home not my business. The athletes and coaches here are not my employees, they are my family, and most of all the work is not work, it is FUN, it is thrilling, and exciting and a new adventure everyday!</p>

                    <p>I used to watch the CrossFit games on ESPN a while back but always thought CrossFit training facilities were scarce. A friend of mine introduced me to the one on the Riverfront and I’ve been hooked ever since. Outside of CrossFit I bartend at Tyler Fitzgerald’s.</p>
                    <p>I have played sports all through out grade school and even played a year of football and lacrosse at Moravian, a small Division III school in Bethlehem PA. Throughout my years of athletics I have been coached through a lot of olympic style lifting and circuit training. During college I did a lot of reading on my own of proper resistance training regimens but was not introduced to CrossFit until about 2 months ago in July.</p>

                    <p>I first picked up crossfit while in bootcamp with the army in 2008. I played sports in high school and I really liked how the drill instructor ran the workouts. I never really knew what they were but I was always winded and beat up. I got in touch with him a few years later and told him that I had been doing this thing called crossfit and it's a lot like what he had us do. He said, "what do you think you did in bootcamp, dumby!"</p>
                    <p>I just recently returned from a tour overseas with the Delaware Army National Guard. I am still currently enlisted in the military and I try to help all of my subordinates and my superiors get into better shape training with crossfit.</p>

                    <p>Originally from Dover, my love for sports and fitness began with swimming at the young age of 4 and fell in love with the sport.  I swam competitively until my senior year of high school and qualified for States in the 100yd Breaststroke and 50yd Free 3 of 4 years.  During high school and college I coached summer and winter swim teams in the North Wilmington area.    I graduated from the University of Delaware with a degree in Leadership and I am currently pursuing my J.D. at Villanova School of Law.</p>
                    <p>In 2011, when I began law school I found myself missing the exercise, fun and most of all the sense of community that comes with participating in or coaching any competitive sport, and that is when I found Crossfit.  I joined the Riv in the summer of 2012 and felt at home instantly.   My favorite thing about crossfit, besides feeling stronger everyday, is the amazing family and sense of community we have at the Riverfront. </p>

                    <p>I first became interested in Crossfit while in nursing school.  One of my best friends in school was always talking about how great Crossfit was and finally convinced me to try a class.  After my first class I felt pretty beat up but also had the drive to come back for more.  I had played sports all my life including volleyball at the collegiate level. I finally felt like I had found an outlet for athletic competition. I originally got into coaching at the high school level and enjoyed coaching ice hockey players during their “dry land” training.</p>
                    <p>To me, Crossfit is one of those things you never master.  Weekly or monthly I am hitting my goals and making new strives to be a better Crossfit athlete.  Most recently I have set a new personal record for my jerk, and have learned to link movements like kipping and butterfly pull-ups.  Constantly striving to better my performance in a WOD is what keeps me coming in.</p>

                    <p>I have been crossfitting since 2007. It seemed like a good option as far as getting back in to a fitness routine after returning home from 4 years of active duty serving in the Marine Corps. Turns out it was an amazing fit and I've never looked back. The community aspect of crossfit is my favorite part of crossfit...cheering people on, friendly competition, and watching people constantly improve. I grew up in north Wilmington, and love the area. I have been a riv member since July of 2011.</p>

                    <p>I believe that in order to improve overall wellness you must start with a healthy lifestyle, starting with nutritional knowledge and fitness goals. It is never to early or to late in life to get strong, and overcome obstacles that once seemed intimidating. I was a decathlete at West Chester University, where I discovered my love for lifting and athletic competition. After that I obtained a degree in nutrition at the University of Delaware. I have been lucky enough to implement and share what I have learned throughout my Crossfit journey.</p>
                    <p>I met Meredith in 2008 through a mutual friend and box owner.  Since then, I have been a personal trainer in Wilmington and now a Crossfit coach which has allowed me to share, teach, and learn from all of the athletes and trainers I have worked with. My certifications include NASM CPT, CES and CrossFit Level 1. There is nothing I love more then a fitness journey. If you have any questions or concerns I am always willing and able to listen.</p>
